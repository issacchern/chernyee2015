									<h2>My Portfolio</h2>
									<p align=left>I am a programmer, software developer, and engineer.  <br />

								</header>
								<p>My name is Chern Yee Chua. I have a nickname "Issac" for myself because people always have a hard time remembering and pronouncing my name right.
                                    
                                    I am a computer engineering student at University at Buffalo. As a computer engineer, we learn engineering principles and computer science and technology. 
                                    From software to hardware, from theory to hands-on. My favorite parts of being a computer engineering student is that we do writing code and debugging program, 
                                    designing software application and experiencing with software/hardware interfaces.              
                                    
                                    Below shows some of my technical skills and ablities as well as the projects that I have worked  / been working on. Thank you very much!</p>

											<h4>Project "Sapphire"</h4>
											<p>
                                                Project Sapphire is a research based project under supervision of Professor Alphonce and Professor Ramamurthy. I have developed an eclipse plugin software
                                                that captures all the changes under JavaModel in Eclipse application and outputs the data to a file. The purpose of this project is to study the process 
                                                of how beginner students learn coding. By analyzing the data inputs from students, we can effectively improve the teaching's quality and style.

											<h4>Project "Fairwell"</h4>
											<p>
                                                Project Fairwell is a semester long group project for Software Engineering class. Project Fairwell is a project that handles the debt issues with friends, 
                                                very much like Splitwise, but our aim is to create a more user-friendly and convenient app for the users. As a team leader of this project, I divided the group 
                                                into three teams: Android, IOS and web team. I am working on Android part of the project.

											<h4>Bomberman in ARM Assembly</h4>
											<p>My partner and I wrote and designed the classic Nintendo Bomberman game in ARM assembly language using ARM6 microprocessor and UART serial communication. We used
                                                PuTTy to establish the connection with the ARM6 integrated circuit board. We also fully utilized GPIO peripherals such as LEDs, push buttons, 7-Segment display and etc.

											<h4>Top Down Parsing Tree</h4>
											<p>
                                                I developed a toy programming language that followed Chomsky notation with Extended Backus-Naur Form in Java. 
                                                This program was designed to handle syntatic and semantic errors effectively. It could also be debugging by JIVE - an eclipse plugin extension, which generated
                                                a whole object diagram parsing tree from the root object. 
                        
                                                 This project demonstrated the significance of object-oriented programming.

											<h4>Android Game "Who is Undercover?" </h4>
											<p>This is a famous chinese board game that I have created awhile ago using AppInventor. My intention is to share this awesome game with my non-chinese speakers and also
                                                enhance my programming skills. Checkout this game by clicking the link below, game instrcution can be found inside the game. Enjoy!</p>

                                            In my free time, I like working out and writing codes. I have a very strong passion in learning and I also enjoy creating wonderful stuff such as websites, software 
                                            applications and etc. During last summer, I taught myself web design and android development. I consider myself as a "geek" as the reason that I
                                            like checking out new technogical stuff such as computers, electronic devices, software applications and so on to get some sense of what technology has changed and 
                                            impacted our life. I am also enthusiastic in life that I always seek for opportunties to improve and make myself better in every aspect, aiming and achieving goals.

									<h5>My girlfriend &amp; I</h5>
									<p align=justify><span class="image left"><img src="images/1.jpg" alt="" width = "210px"/></span>
                                        
                                        This is my girlfriend, Janice. We have been dating for over a year now. We met during friends' trip to Darien Lake. I really enjoy her accompany throughout our sememsters
                                        at UB. Now she has graduated and she found a job as E-Commerce specialist at NYC. Even though she is 500 miles away from me, I believe long distance relationship will not break 
                                        our feelings for each other but will make our love stronger. I am glad to meet her and have her in my life. 
      
                                        
                                        </p>
									<p align=justify><span class="image right"><img src="images/3.JPG" width = "260px" alt="" /></span> One weakness about me is that I don't simply risk myself in doing something that will 
                                        affect my primary goal - which is my studies at UB. My unwillingness of trying something new makes me lose a lot of good opportunities to broaden my view and enrich my life. 
                                        As soon as I realized the weakness of mine, I decided to start participating in many meaningful events such as joining Tau Beta Pi Honor Society, taking part in Hackathon, tutoring 
                                        for honor club, attending talks and etc. 
                                    
                                        I am also very fortunate to be selected as an undergraduate research assistant and work with my favorite professors! Life is full of meaning and challenges, I
                                        will never give up and that I will give the best shot in my studies, my career, my love and my life.
